# StBrendans Website Frontend


PHP, HTML5 and javascript files for the St Brendan's Website

The inital task was to redo the front end while maintaining links to the previously purpose built CMS.

The Website was designed and setup with new requested functions such as the calendar and the noticeboards.

I new photogallery was setup but later was replaced with Google photo albums

While it was created in 2006-2007, the website remains up
For security reasons I did not include the Admin folder.
